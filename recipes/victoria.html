        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey </li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice (or juice of 1 lemon)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar </li>
        <li> 2 heaping tablespoon minced garlic </li>
        <li>6 whole garlic cloves , peeled </li>
        <li>Lemon slices and zest to garnish </li>
        <li>Sliced green onions, to garnish </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 360°F | 180°C.</li>
        <li>Place chicken thighs in a large shallow dish and season with salt; set aside.</li>
        <li> IN a large mixing jug, whisk together the honey, lemon juice, soy sauce, vinegar and minced garlic.<br>
            Pour about 1/4 cup of the sauce over the chicken ( or just enough to lightly coat each thing) and rotate
            each thigh
            to coat evenly in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat an oven-proof skillet over medium high heat; sear the chicken skin
            side down first until golden for about 5 minutes. Turn and repeat on the
            other side. Drain most of the excess oil from the pan, leaving about 1
            tablespoonfor added flavour.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange chicken skin-side up in the pan; add the whole garlic cloves
            between the chicken; pour half of the remaining sauce over each thigh
            (about 1-2 tablespooons per thigh) and bake for 40-45 minutes untilthe
            chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear. The skin should be
            crispy and sticky.
        </li>
        <li>While the chicken is baking, pour te remaining sauce into a small pot
            (or saucepan), and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat
            down to low and allow to simmer while occasionally stiiring; lifting the
            pot off of the heat when the sauce bubbles up to the rim of your pot,
            and repeat the process until thesauce has sightlly reduced and thickened (about 6 minutes).</li>
        <li>Serve with the remaining sauce, lemon zest and slices, and sliced green onions (optional).</li>
    </ol>
