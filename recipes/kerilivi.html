    <H2>Ingredients</H2>
    <ul>
        <li>250 grams cubed boneless chicken</li>
        <li>½ tsp red chilli powder</li>
        <li>1 - 1.5 tsp fresh ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>½ tsp black pepper powder</li>
        <li>¼ tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 - 2 tsp lime juice</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all the spices, ginger garlic paste, salt, and lime
        <li></li>Clean the chicken pieces and place in a bowl</li>
        juice to this</li>
        <li>Mix well until the chicken pieces are well coated. You can
            also mix the marinade ingredients first in the bowl and then add the chicken pieces and mix together</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for a few hours. You can also fry
            immediately if short on time</li>
        <li>Heat oil for deep frying and gently add the chicken pieces
            to it without overcrowding them</li>
        <li>Fry on medium heat stirring occasionally until the chicken
            pieces are golden brown</li>
        <li>Take out one piece and test to see if the pieces are fully
            cooked</li>
        <li>When done, drain and place on kitchen towels for the
            excess oil to get absorbed</li>
        <li>Proceed with the remaining pieces until all done</li>
        <li>Serve hot with rice, any curry, and a simple salad. It's
            best to consume chicken fry on the same day you prepare them</li>
    </ol>
